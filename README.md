The goal of this project is to work through creating a web page with an Etch-a-sketch activity on it.  This will be a task that involves using all of the skills I have obtained from The Odin Project so far.  Essentially, the user will get to select the size of a grid which will contain squares that change color when the mouse hovers over them.  There will also be an option for the user to clear the grid to it's original blank slate.  There will be a limit of 100 x 100 for the grid to draw on.   As well, this is good practice for me improving my git commits.  I am meant to use Javascript to make this page rather than a heavy reliance on HTML.


First Step: Set up initial 16 x 16 grid of square divs using Javascript
